                    <h2>Life at The Dorm</h2>
                    <p>When i was at senior high school, i went to a boarding school. one of the reason i chose a boarding school is actually to seek discomfort. 
                        I do believe to actually grow in life, you need to seek discomfort, the things you actually don't like is what actually makes you a better individual. 
                        And forcing myself to live in the dorm has been one of the best desicion in my life, i have learned a lot of things and met the best people on earth. 
                        At the dorm, it just felt like we are a family.

                    <h2>Making Friends</h2>
                    <p>Here is a photo of my friends at the dorm, i don't really know what they are actually doing, i do actually thing the one squating down, looking at his track record, he is drunk af! i mean look at him.
                        the one standing is one of my best friends, he is a very nice guy, he loves to mock me a lot but at the end of the day, he's the one who's gonna have my back.

                    <h2>Taking The Leap</h2>
                    <p>Looking back at my days in the dorm, laughing together, having fun and stuff, sometimes i just have a thought like "can i stay in this moment forever?" 
                        but the answer is... no. At the end of the day, life needs to go on. Life at the dorm have taught me a lot of valuable lessons and memories. 
                        and i do believe those lessons are taught for a reason, you're not going to forge a knife forever, there are times where you are going to use it because if not, then it's useless after all. 
                        So thinking about it, i do believe it's time for another chapter in my life, and a new exciting journey awaits!

                    <h2>A New Journey</h2>
                    <p>And now, here i am, making this portofolio project. I am currently going through a new journey in tech! 
                        so far, it's been very fun, i've met a lot of new valuable friends, and here are their photos. I'm hoping to learn more in this field, especially in developing a software.

                    <h2>What's Next?</h2>
                    <p>Now, here's another question, what's next? what am i seeking? what's my next goal in life? 
                        you know what, i don't care. i'm just going to let life goes on. my goal in life is just to always be happy, spreading usefulness and happiness, 
                        and at the end of the day, going home to where i always belong: God. we are going to die anyways so as long as we are still living, it's our chance to spread usefulness and joy.
